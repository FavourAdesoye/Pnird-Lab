Psychoneuroimmunology of Risk and Disease (PNIRD) Lab
Virginia State University – Department of Psychology
1. Lab Overview
- The Psychoneuroimmunology of Risk and Disease (PNIRD) Lab is an academic research lab based a
t Virginia State University (VSU) in the Department of Psychology.
- The lab focuses on how psychological, neurological, and immune processes interact to shape he
alth outcomes, especially in Black and other minoritized communities.
- Core interests include substance use (particularly cannabis), stress, mood, cardiovascular fu
nction, and neurocognitive performance.
2. Mission and Focus
- PNIRD’s mission is to understand how “risk” factors (such as substance use, psychosocial stre
ss, and health disparities) and protective factors (such as coping, self-compassion, and social
 support) influence the brain, immune system, and behavior.
- The lab emphasizes:
 • Substance use patterns (e.g., marijuana) and their impact on heart, brain, and immune funct
ion.
 • Psychosocial factors such as racism, trauma, depression, anxiety, and coping.
 • Neurocognitive outcomes such as executive function, working memory, and cognitive flexibili
ty.
 • Immune and autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability (HRV), leukocyte counts, and in
flammatory markers.
3. Key Concepts for the Chatbot
- Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI): An interdisciplinary field that studies how psychological proces
ses (thoughts, emotions, stress) interact with the nervous system and the immune system.
- Autonomic Nervous System (ANS): The part of the nervous system that controls automatic functi
ons like heart rate and breathing. It includes the sympathetic (“fight or flight”) and parasymp
athetic (“rest and digest”) branches.
- Heart-Rate Variability (HRV): A measure of the variation in time between heartbeats. It can b
e used as a non-invasive indicator of autonomic balance and stress regulation.
- Cannabis / Marijuana: A psychoactive substance that can influence cardiovascular function, mo
od, cognition, and immune markers. PNIRD often examines its effects in community and college sa
mples.
- Health Disparities: Differences in health outcomes that affect minoritized or underserved gro
ups (e.g., Black communities) due to structural and social factors.
4. Typical Populations and Methods
- Populations:
 • Black and African American undergraduates at HBCUs.
 • Black community samples, including people living with HIV.
 • Young adults and mid-life adults with varied substance-use histories.
- Methods and Measures:
 • Self-report questionnaires on mood, stress, trauma history, coping, self-compassion, and su
bstance use.
 • Neurocognitive tests (e.g., tasks measuring executive function, working memory, and cogniti
ve flexibility).
 • Physiological measures such as heart-rate variability and cardiac indices.
 • Immune markers such as CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts and systemic inflammation markers.
5. Example Research Themes
- Cannabis and the Immune System:
 • Studies comparing immune cell counts (e.g., CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes) between people who d
o and do not use marijuana.
 • Questions include: Does cannabis use weaken the immune system? How does it relate to inflam
mation in people living with HIV?
- Cannabis and the Heart-Brain Connection:
 • Work on how cannabis use relates to autonomic function (heart-rate patterns, HRV) and neuro
cognitive performance.
 • Interest in whether certain patterns of autonomic activation are associated with better or
worse cognitive functioning.
- HRV and Executive Function in Black College Students:
 • Studies of how resting autonomic activity and HRV relate to performance on tasks assessing
cognitive flexibility, errors, and categories completed.
- Trauma, Violence Exposure, and Mental Health:
 • Research on how lifetime violence exposure and trauma relate to life satisfaction, delinque
nt behaviors, and mental-health symptoms.
- Self-Compassion and Psychological Well-Being:
 • Investigations of the validity and usefulness of self-compassion measures in HBCU student s
amples and how self-compassion relates to mood symptoms.
6. Cannabis Nexus Initiative (CNI) – Example Project
- The Cannabis Nexus Initiative is a PNIRD project that examines how cannabis use is linked to
health outcomes through biological and psychosocial pathways.
- Broad aims include:
 • Understanding patterns of cannabis use in community and college samples.
 • Studying how cannabis use relates to autonomic and immune markers.
 • Exploring how cannabis interacts with stress, mood, and other behavioral health variables.
- Interested individuals can contact the lab for information about participating in CNI and rel
ated projects.
7. Lab Leadership and Team (High-Level)
- Director: Dr. Larry Keen II (Associate Professor, Psychology, VSU; PNIRD Lab Director).
 • Research interests include psychoneuroimmunological influences of cannabis use and neurocog
nitive performance in community-based and young adult samples, and substance use patterns in yo
ung adults and their associations with psychological and autonomic nervous system markers.
- The lab team typically includes:
 • Graduate students and lab coordinators who help manage projects and mentor undergraduates.
 • Undergraduate research assistants who support data collection, data entry, and literature r
eview.
 • Collaborators at partner institutions (e.g., University of Miami and other universities) fo
r joint research on cannabis and health.
8. Student Roles and Training
- Undergraduate students:
 • Assist with survey administration, participant recruitment, scheduling, and study visits.
 • Help with data entry, basic data analysis, and literature searches.
 • Present posters and talks at research symposia and conferences.
- Graduate students and coordinators:
 • Take lead roles in designing studies, managing datasets, supervising RAs, and writing manus
cripts.
- Training Emphasis:
 • Ethical research conduct (e.g., informed consent, confidentiality).
 • Cultural competence when working with Black and minoritized participants.
 • Strong quantitative and scientific-writing skills.
9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for a PNIRD Chatbot
Q1. What does “PNIRD” stand for?
A. PNIRD stands for Psychoneuroimmunology of Risk and Disease Laboratory.
Q2. Where is the PNIRD Lab located?
A. The lab is housed at Virginia State University in the Department of Psychology in Virginia,
USA.
Q3. What are the main topics PNIRD studies?
A. PNIRD focuses on substance use (especially cannabis), stress, mood, cardiovascular function,
 neurocognition, and immune markers in Black and other underserved populations.
Q4. What kinds of participants does PNIRD usually recruit?
A. Many PNIRD studies recruit Black college students at HBCUs and Black community members, incl
uding people living with HIV, depending on the project.
Q5. Does cannabis always harm the immune system?
A. PNIRD research suggests that the relationship between cannabis and immune markers is complex
. In some studies, cannabis users had higher immune cell counts than non-users. The lab is stil
l investigating what this means for overall health.
Q6. What is heart-rate variability (HRV) and why does it matter?
A. HRV is a measure of beat-to-beat variation in heart rate. It is used to understand how the a
utonomic nervous system responds to stress and rest. PNIRD uses HRV to study how autonomic bala
nce relates to cognitive performance and mental health.
Q7. How can students get involved with PNIRD?
A. Interested students can contact the lab’s email or lab director, ask about open research ass
istant positions, and share their interests in topics like substance use, mental health, and he
alth disparities.
